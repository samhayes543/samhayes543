- Hi, I’m Samuel Hayes, a recently graduated Cognitive Science student from UC San Diego.
- I’m interested in the human capacity for learning, particularly in building tools that can optimize our learning processes.
- I'm also interested in Machine Learning as a set of tools for teaching computers to learn from experience.
- I hope to join these two interests in future projects, as I believe Machine Learning can provide some of the most effective tools
 for extending our capacity for growth in the modern world.
- I’m currently studying Machine Learning in a post-graduate program to build on the knowledge I gained in several
 data science and machine learning courses at UCSD.
- I’m looking to collaborate on applications that will help individuals to structure their learning processes
